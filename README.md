# AEON Jewellery – E-Commerce Website

A modern, luxury jewellery e-commerce website for the **AEON** brand with an admin dashboard and Render.com deployment.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local)

```bash
npm install
node scripts/seed.js   # seed products from categoriess/ images (auto-runs on Render build)
npm start              # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔐 Admin Dashboard

URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin`  
Default password: **`aeon2024`**

> **For production on Render:** Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the Render dashboard → Environment Variables.

---

## 🌐 Deploy to Render.com

1. Push this project to a **GitHub repository**
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Render auto-detects `render.yaml` – all settings are pre-configured
5. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong password in **Environment → Add Variable**
6. Click **Deploy** ✅

### Important Notes
- The `categoriess/` folder must be included in your commit (it contains the product images)
- Uploaded admin images go to `uploads/` – these will reset on Render free tier redeploys (use persistent disk or cloud storage for production)
- `data/products.json` persists during runtime but resets on redeploy – consider migrating to a database (MongoDB, Supabase) for production
